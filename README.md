This is a "lightning talk" (less than 10 minutes) I prepared for Hackbright.  
It's about using the Decimal module in Python to avoid floating-point inaccuracy problems.  
Or rather, to handle inaccuracies in a way a human working in base 10 would expect.

Warning: I made this in Beamer so the way the PDF shows slides with pieces appearing one
at a time, is to put redundant content on multiple pages.  So if you are printing, don't
print all the pages: in this case I recommend pages 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 16.
